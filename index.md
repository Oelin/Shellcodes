# Index of Shellcodes

This document provides details and brief explanations of each Shellcode featured within this repository; ordered by upload date. 
The various compilation methods for each are given by reference in parenthesis and shown fully in `./compile.md`.

### execve
An archetypal Shellcode which uses the `execve()` system call to open Linux's basic shell `/bin/sh` from within a vulnerable program. (1) (25 bytes).

### execve_bind

In many cases, Shellcodes are used to exploit programs on remote hosts rather than a physically accessable machine. As such, this Shellcode pipes the input and output of `/bin/sh` through client TCP connections. In exploit circumstances, Shellcodes of this type can lead to system wide compramise. execve_bind accepts connections on port 1234. (1) (123 bytes).

### exeve_tiny

exeve_tiny, is a variant of execve crafted to be only 21 bytes. Such a small Shellcode can be used even when buffers are limiting. (1) (21 bytes).

### seed

Commonly, exploits can be greatly limited by small buffers, only 30 bytes or so. seed attempts to overcome buffer limitations by injecting code into a process' memory offset from the buffer and branching to that location. Code to be injected is downloaded via curl specified by a URL.
